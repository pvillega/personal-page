Welcome visitor, I'm Pere Villega, a software developer born in Barcelona and living in Dublin. 

### What is this?

This is my personal page. I felt that, somehow, I'm not tailored to keep a standard blog. I hate that layout in which you seem to be forced to write just to not show you didn't for the last month. As if the gap is there then it seems you were just lazy and procrastinated instead of publishing. Who minds you were coding?

I don't like how it takes the focus out of your projects, keeping them in a tiny sidebar. I want to show my code, ugly as it may be. It's what I do, what defines me, what motivates me. I wanted something else.

So I created this. My place. I own it. I rule it. And you can [clone it][1] and deploy your own version if you like. This site is my small place on the [tubes][2], where I speak my mind, I store links that I find relevant or I show what I'm working on. 

Welcome! Make yourself comfortable!

### So who I am?

I'm a nerd. Correction, a [happily married][3] nerd, and (I believe) a decent husband :) 

I like coding. I've been doing stuff for many years, trying new technologies, doing small personal projects. Many of them are lost as they were not "relevant" (amateurish hacks in an unmastered language which I did not keep when replacing computers), but I keep some stuff in [Github][4]. To be honest my love for programming has grown a lot since I discovered Scala and Play Framework. I feel comfortable working with them (even if I'm not an expert) and the way they facilitate creating new apps motivates me to work more and more. To be fair, I may focus a bit too much on tackling "nice engineering issues" more than the full product, but oh well... trying to improve that part!

I love reading. In fact, I like it so much that I have no TV at home. No time for it. Since I got my new Kindle (January 2012) I've read close to 27 books, including all the saga of Capitan Alatriste, The Hunger Games trilogy, the full Vorkosigan saga (with Ethan of Athos and Falling Free) and several others. I get hooked on stories, I need to know what will happen next. And I read fast :) 

I play games. Board games, role games, videogames... you name it. I enjoy them, I'm currently spending some time in Diablo III. Sadly I don't have as much time for them as I would like, but if I have to choose between coding and playing, coding wins the battle. Little secret: I want to create my own game. Someday.

I support Manchester United. To be honest I don't watch many matches, if any at all. But I support them. Not every choice has to be rational, does it?

I like Linux. And Android, of which I own one (Galaxy S 2). I need to learn to code for Android (pending task!). But I really like the freedom of choice related to both systems.

I can't stand Apple. Nothing against the brand itself, it's the way they twist facts via marketing and how their drones follow them in a hive-mind fashion (no free thought allowed) that irks me.

### What do I do?

I solve problems using software. Technically I'm a software developer, but I don't like how this gives a limited vision of the task. My job is to solve issues using software. To make something work properly to fulfil a need. To make people happy (or less unhappy) via a computer.

I deliver. I pride myself of delivering working solutions on time. There's been failures here and there, specially years ago when I was learning and I overcommitted, but I'm driven by result: if something can't be delivered on time I have failed. I didn't do my job. And I hate that feeling. So, I focus and I deliver.

I improve things. It may be a bit of an obsession of mine, but I like clean code and structures. And I like automation that reduces repetitive work (which I dislike). Granted, sometimes my code is not great (and I thank code reviews for their existence). But once I see an issue I'll go the extra mile to solve it, either via automation of a task or by refactoring that fragment.

I code. Currently in Scala and Java and using Play Framework for HTML 5 apps. But it may change. Clojure? Node.js? Who knows. The down side is that with so many interesting things around in the software world choosing is hard.

I've created a site to manage [Play Framework modules][5]. I was part of [GSOC 2010][6]. I did this site. And after it I'll find some other project to work in. 

### What's going on in the home page?

Just a bit of nerd love in the form of famous quotes. Can you identify all of them? (hint: I can't!)

### What do I want from you?

Feel free to comment in the site. To send feedback. Contact me. Interact. I promise that besides a nerd I'm a nice guy, and I'll try to answer. Of course you are not required to, but I would really appreciate it. 

That said, spam and other [Netiquette][7] violations are a big no-no. Be nice ;)
