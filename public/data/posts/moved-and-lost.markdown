So, the blog has been migrated. Sadly, due to format issues and my sloppiness, several posts have been lost. Like in gone. Forever. Nothing too relevant that can't be found in other palces, but over 2 years of posts are gone. 

Yeah, it sucks. And stings a bit. It's time spent and gone for nothing.  Oh, well, let's try to keep the bright side. Let's take the chance to start from scratch and improve the content :)

See you soon!
