This year I've been accepted in GSOC 2010, for a project where I'll create a unit testing scaffold for DSpace, an open source application I use a lot at my current work. For starters I've been creating some basic documentation on [Testing](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/GSOC/Testing) for the DSpace community. 

Please feel free to add comments and corrections!
