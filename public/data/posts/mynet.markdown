One of the many reasons I've been out-of-contact these past weeks (and barely posting) is that I'm finishing my Master in Open Source Software by UOC. I've had to develop a project for it, and I've chosen to develop a portal similar to Pirate Bay. You can checkout the code [here](https://bitbucket.org/pvillega/mynet) at Bitbucket.The project is a Java web application and it uses Seam as framework.

I warn you the project is under development and more of a "minimal viable product" than anything else. Don't expect awesome code, but it has served me to work with Seam in something "serious" and I learned a lot. Sadly code is only 30% of the final grade, so now it's time to polish it a bit and document, document, document...
